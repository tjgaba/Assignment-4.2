## Developer Onboarding (In Progress)

If the distributers do join the project, here are following notes to consider.

The purpose of this section is to help new contributors to understand 
- What this system is intended to become
- How documentation  is organised, this includes files of the project too.
- Where to find key project artefacts, also how to navigate to them.
