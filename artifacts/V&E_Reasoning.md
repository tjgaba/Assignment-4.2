# Velocity & Estimation Reasoning

| Story                    | Complexity | Points |
| ------------------------ | ---------- | ------ |
| 1 Basic room booking     | High       | 8      |
| 2 Recurring meetings     | High       | 8      |
| 3 Booking cancellation   | Low        | 2      |
| 4 Capacity filtering     | Low        | 2      |
| 5 Equipment requirements | Medium     | 5      |
| 6 Admin dashboard        | High       | 8      |
| 7 Conflict resolution    | High       | 8      |
| 8 Usage reports          | High       | 8      |
| 9 Maintenance scheduling | Low        | 2      |
| 10 Visitor assistance    | Low        | 2      |

Total Story Points

8 + 8 + 2 + 2 + 5 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 2 + 2 = 53 story points
Note: points changes on assignment 2.2 = 20 points per sprint. Therefore it will change
from 10 to 20.
Velocity = 20 points per sprint.
            53 / 20 = 2.65 (Rounded = 3)
            Therefore 3 Sprints.

Reasoning:

Story points were estimated based on the technical complexity of each user story, where low complexity stories were assigned 2 points, medium complexity 5 points, and high complexity 8 points. This approach reflects the relative effort, risk, and uncertainty involved in implementing each feature rather than measuring actual time. By focusing on complexity, the team can prioritize work more effectively and ensure that challenging tasks receive appropriate attention during planning.

The total estimated effort across all user stories is 53 story points. To maintain a realistic pace, a team velocity of 10 story points per sprint is ideal. This assumes a small development team of approximately five members with fair experience, taking into account not only coding effort but also planning, testing, and potential technical hindrances that may arise during the sprint. Typical hindrances include unclear requirements, dependencies conflict from other team members, technical issues such as bugs, or waiting for approvals from stakeholders, all of which can delay progress.

Based on this velocity, the project is expected to require roughly six sprints to complete all planned stories (53 ÷ 10 ≈ 5.3, rounded up). This estimation allows the team to deliver consistently while maintaining quality and avoiding overcommitment. This will help ensuring each feature is properly developed, tested, and integrated before moving on to the next sprint.
