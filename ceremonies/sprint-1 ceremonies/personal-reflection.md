# Sprint 1 — Personal Reflection

## Key Learning
What was the most important lesson you learned about how work actually flows during a
sprint?

- I have personally learned that proper planning in regards to the different elements of the whole system, requires them to be intertwined or integrated seamlessly with each core element of the system. From database, user interface to backend code, it should make sense why and when each element is to be pulled into the sprint. Everything should be connected.

## Assumptions That Failed
Which assumption (planning, estimation, communication, execution) broke down the most?

- Personally, the Estimation element of the planning really took me offgard and didn't really go according to how i have imagened it.
Putting a timeline expecially on a system or feature you havent done before is not very idea. So giving extratime on a project to tackle unforseen come-ups or edge-cases is good practice. 

## Assumptions That Failed

- I assumed that our time estimates were solid, but they didn’t fully match how things played out. Story #10 in particular took longer than expected, which showed that even a small story can have hidden complexity. I learned that estimation needs more discussion and should include some buffer for surprises.


## Behavioural Change
What is one concrete behaviour you would change in Sprint 2?

- Proper planning and more proper planning to be honest. Seriously. If there is on mistake or improper planning along the planning face, that
has a cascading effect on the whole sprint. That is why after deciding on the sprint backlog, there is close to zore chance for the sprint backlog to change. Because once it changes, this mean the Asana workflow should also change, meaning everyone also has to backtrack since everything is connected on the work flow. Its eaither one or more element would cease while others are revisited. Wasting time and resources.

## Professional Growth
What skill or habit do you need to strengthen to perform better in a real Scrum team?

- Understanding each team member's task, wherther its data base, UI and backend, you need to be able to read and make sence of the implimentations and changes done on each side.
