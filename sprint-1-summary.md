**Burndown Description:**  
- The team made steady progress throughout Sprint 1, completing most tasks during the early and middle stages of the sprint. By the end of the sprint, all planned stories and their subtasks were completed. However, the final story (Story #10 – Visitor booking assistance) gave some challenges and took longer than expected, which slightly delayed closing tasks but did not prevent full delivery.
